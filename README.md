# Employee Recruitment System (Frontend)

This project is a **frontend-only** web-based Employee Recruitment System built with AngularJS.  
It is designed as a demo to showcase the user interface and basic client-side logic for managing job vacancies and candidate applications.

> Note: This repository contains **only the frontend (UI)** part of the system.  
> The backend (CodeIgniter 3) and database (MySQL) used in the original project are **not included** in this repository.

## Features (Frontend Demo)

- **Job Vacancy List (UI)**
  - Display job vacancies (position, department, status, etc.)
  - Layout prepared for integration with API data in the future

- **Candidate Application Form**
  - Form for candidate personal data and application submission
  - Client-side validation for required fields (e.g. name, email, phone, position applied)

- **Application Status (UI)**
  - UI components for showing application status (e.g. Applied, Shortlisted, Interview, Hired, Rejected)
  - Designed to be connected to backend logic / API later

- **Responsive Layout (if applicable)**
  - Basic responsive design for desktop usage (adjust this based on your implementation)

You can adjust/add/remove the items above to match the actual screens you have in the project.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: AngularJS  
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **UI Library**: Bootstrap (if used)
